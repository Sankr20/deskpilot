# DeskPilot Risk RegisterLegend:- Severity: Low / Medium / High- Likelihood: Low / Medium / High- Priority: P0 (do now), P1 (next), P2 (later)| ID | Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Priority | Mitigation | Status ||----|------|----------|------------|----------|------------|--------|| R1 | Artifact leakage (screenshots/OCR/logs contain PII/secrets) | High | High | P0 | Default: minimal on success, full bundle on failure; add redaction options; clear docs; strong .gitignore in generated projects | Planned || R2 | `runs/` or artifacts accidentally committed | Medium | High | P0 | Ensure `.gitignore` includes runs/artifacts patterns; README warning | Planned || R3 | Path traversal / arbitrary file write in init/recorder | High | Medium | P0 | Canonicalize root, ensure target startsWith(root); validate names; no overwrite unless --force | Planned || R4 | Wrong-window automation (focus changed) | High | Medium | P1 | Confirm selected target; optional scope lock and re-confirm | Planned || R5 | Clipboard data exposure | Medium | Medium | P1 | Optional clipboard restore; avoid logging clipboard contents | Planned || R6 | Dependency vulnerabilities / supply chain | High | Medium | P0 | Dependabot + dependency scanning + SBOM + pinned plugins | Planned || R7 | Release artifact tampering | Medium | Medium | P1 | Publish SHA256 checksums; later add signing for Maven Central | Planned || R8 | DoS via OCR/template loops or huge images | Medium | Medium | P1 | Timeouts, retry caps, artifact caps, image size caps | Planned || R9 | CI publishes sensitive artifacts publicly | High | Medium | P0 | Docs + defaults; CI should never upload `runs/` by default | Planned |## Notes- DeskPilot’s diagnostic artifacts are a core feature. The goal is **safe-by-default**, not removing diagnostics.- Mitigations are designed to be configurable via options/flags so capability remains intact.
